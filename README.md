# fortnite-mouse-accel
Quickly edit your sensitivity and enable or disable mouse accel/smoothing in your [Fortnite](https://fortnite.com/) config, while also keeping it read only so it doesn't reset

**Trying to edit the settings seems to reset certain config settings, so if you edit your settings in game you might have to run this tool again**

## Using
Simply download the latest [release](https://github.com/smt923/fortnite-mouse-accel/releases) and run it, it'll find the right path by it's self and ask you if you want mouse accel on or off, simply type your answer (on or off) and hit enter, run again to change.
