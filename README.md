# fortnite-mouse-accel


### Due to recent patches this tool doesn't really provide any benefit anymore, but should still be functional


Quickly edit your sensitivity and enable or disable mouse accel/smoothing in your [Fortnite](https://fortnite.com/) config, while also keeping it read only so it doesn't reset

**Using the in game options menu seems to reset certain config options, so if you edit your options in game you might have to run this tool again**

## Using
Simply download the latest [release](https://github.com/smt923/fortnite-mouse-accel/releases) and run it, it'll find the right path by it's self and ask you if you want mouse accel on or off, simply type your answer (on or off) and hit enter, run again to change.
